The problem that teamA will solve is predicting the type of crime and how often it
occurs in certain locations in Los Angeles County. The crime rate has risen in the
California region over the years, and many first responders tend to lack
resources/information on how to approach each daily call. By implementing an ML
algorithm from the Los Angeles Police Department data sample, TeamA should be able
to predict when certain crimes occur, based on location in Los Angeles County, the time
of day, and previous offense. This information is important for the first responder to
prioritize patrolling certain locations over others and having information on what type of
crime they will mostly encounter. Having prior information based on this prediction will
help first responders evaluate the situation ahead of time before arrival. This will help
deescalate crime in certain environments and identify areas that could be problematic
based on time and day. Some critical features are time, date, and location in Los
Angeles County. Some data that may be excluded are the type of weapon and case
status. We are more concerned about the crime reported in our data set. The outcome
variable is the type of crime and it is supervised, as the correct outcome is stored in the
data, with a sample size of 974,477.
